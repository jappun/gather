### ‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE: You will see errors when you try to interact with the UI
This is expected! Your local copy won't have access to my Supabase project. You're welcome to set up your own Supabase project. Then put your project keys into a .env file that  looks like this:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
```
You'll also need to set up your tables correctly as the program expects. If you want the database schema, email me at jpdhillon07@gmail.com
